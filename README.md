**Meproc** is a process management service that can start, stop, and restart specified programs in a specified manner through an HTTP API.

Features:
- Support Restful API to start, stop, restart process groups, and view currently running process groups
- Support some simple dependencies between process groups
- Support cron jobs
- Support one-time tasks
- Support setting execution users and user groups for processes
- Support multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.
- The project only needs to pre-install the Melang interpreter, and no more others need to be installed.



## Installation

Meproc is written in [Melang](https://github.com/Water-Melon/Melang) language, which means that you need to install and only install Melang, then Meproc can be started up.

You can pull the built docker image.

```
docker pull melonc/meproc
```



## Quick Start



### Start Meproc

```bash
melang meproc.m
```

Then you can see the output that Meproc service listening address.

The default IP is `127.0.0.1` and port is `8606`.



### Start process

Here is a simple example.

```bash
curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep1", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2, "user": "guest"}'
```

Using a PUT HTTP request to start up a new process.

`name` is the task name. One task is a group of same processes. In this example, we will start up two process to run `sleep 5`.

`once` means that the processes in this task will only be executed once. And there are three values of `type` field:

- `once` means this task will only be executed once even if it exits unexpectedly.
- `daemon` means this task is a daemon, so if this process exits in any reason, it will be restarted.
- `cron` means this task is a cron job, it will contain a field named `cron` in task JSON.
- `user` indicates the user of the new process. Please make sure that Meproc has the permission to do this. `user` and `group` are NOT working on Windows.



Let's take a look at another example.

```bash
curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep2", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2, "deps": ["sleep1"]}'
```

`deps` indicates the list of task names that this task depends on.

The meaning of "dependency" is that when a task is going to be executed, if it finds that the tasks in the `deps` field are already running, it will wait for those tasks to finish before being executed. If the task in the `deps` field of this task has never been executed, it will not prevent this task from being executed.



A cron job example.

```bash
curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep2", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "cron", "cron": "* * * * *", "replica": 2}'
```

This task will be executed every minute.



### Stop process

Let's stop out `sleep1` task.

```bash
curl -v -XDELETE http://127.1:8606/proc?name=sleep1
```



### Restart process

Let's restart task `sleep2`.

```bash
curl -v -XPOST http://127.1:8606/proc?name=sleep2
```

 Restart will stop this task and start it again. And restart is only working on the tasks those are not stopped by `curl -v -XDELETE http://127.1:8606/proc?name=<proc_name>`.



### List all tasks and processes

```bash
curl -v -XGET http://127.1:8606/proc
```

An HTTP response with a JSON body will be returned.



### Change configuration

Configuration file is `conf/conf.m`.

```
Conf = [
    'ip': '0.0.0.0',
    'port': '8606',
    'log_level': 'debug',
    'log_path': '/tmp/Meproc.log',
    'web': [
        'ip': '127.0.0.1',
        'port': '8606',
    ],
];
```

`Conf` is a variable that contains all configurations that Meproc needs. And the name `Conf` can not be changed and it is also case-sensitive.

The address in `web` is used to replace the address in Ajax requests on the web page, which is used to access Meproc to obtain process information. It should be set to the IP and port exposed by the host where Meproc is located."


## Example

We start up Meproc, and run the commands that given below:

```bash
curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep1", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2}'

curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep2", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2, "deps": ["sleep1"]}'

curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep3", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2, "deps": ["sleep1", "sleep2"]}'

curl -v http://127.1:8606/proc

curl -v -XDELETE http://127.1:8606/proc?name=sleep1

curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep1", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "once", "replica": 2}'

curl -v -XPOST http://127.1:8606/proc?name=sleep1

curl -v -XPUT http://127.1:8606/proc -d '{"name": "sleep4", "cmd": "sleep 5", "type": "cron", "cron": "* * * * *", "replica": 2}'
```

We will see the output of Meproc like:
